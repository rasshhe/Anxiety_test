# Anxiety Test â€“ Python Project  
**Psychology-Based CLI Tool using SCAT (Sinhaâ€™s Comprehensive Anxiety Test)**

## Overview  
This project assesses the level of anxiety in individuals using the standardized **Sinhaâ€™s Comprehensive Anxiety Test (SCAT)**. Through 90 structured psychological questions, it evaluates behavioral patterns and symptoms of anxiety. The CLI-based Python tool calculates and interprets scores using sex-based norms to deliver reliable results.

## Functional Highlights

### Core Assessment Logic
- `analyze_answers(answers)`: Calculates a preliminary anxiety score based on user responses  
- `final_score(score, sex)`: Interprets score according to male/female psychological norms defined by SCAT

### Question Handling
- Loads all 90 anxiety evaluation statements from `scat_questions.txt`  
- Captures user responses with strict validation for Yes/No formats  
- Provides real-time interaction via terminal interface  

### User Experience
- Prompts for essential identity fields (Name, Age, Sex, School)  
- Implements `pyfiglet` to enhance interface with stylized titles  
- Ensures clean, clear output showing both numeric score and anxiety level  

## Technical Implementation

### Module Structure
- `main.py`: Controls flow â€” gathers input, processes responses, and displays results  
- `analysis.py`: Contains core logic â€” calculates score and interprets it  
- `scat_questions.txt`: External file storing 90 SCAT-based questions  
- `pyfiglet`: Used for enhancing command-line visual output  

### Anxiety Level Criteria  
(Adjusted using `final_score(anxiety_score, sex)`):

#### For Males:
- 43+ â†’ **Extremely High Anxiety**  
- 28â€“42 â†’ **High Anxiety**  
- 17â€“27 â†’ **Normal Anxiety Level**  
- 1â€“16 â†’ **Low Anxiety**

#### For Females:
- 42+ â†’ **Extremely High Anxiety**  
- 27â€“41 â†’ **High Anxiety**  
- 16â€“26 â†’ **Normal Anxiety Level**  
- 0â€“15 â†’ **Extremely Low Anxiety**
